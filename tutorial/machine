When we log on to the system, the bash program starts, and reads a series of configuration scripts called startup files,
which define the default environment shared by all users.
This is followed by more startup files in our home directory that define our personal environment.



system log in > invoke configuration scripts (aka start up files)


The linux software ecosystem is open source

Device drivers is part of linux kernel

Package management is a method of installing and maintaining software on the system
Two main categories of packaging technology are:
debian (.deb) and red hat (.rpm)

Packaging System                    Distributions (Partial Listing)
Debian Style (.deb)                 Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Raspbian
Red Hat Style (.rpm)                Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSUSE


A package file is a compressed collection of files that comprise the software package.
A package may consist of numerous programs and data files that support the programs.

The package maintainer gets the software in source code form from the upstream provider (the author of the program).

Dependencies
shared libraries, which provide essential services to more than one program.
If a package requires a shared resource such as a shared library, it is said to have a dependency.
Modern package management systems all provide some method of dependency resolution
to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed, too.
